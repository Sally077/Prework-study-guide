# Prework-study-guide webpage

## Description

I enjoy coding in python and wanted to increase my skills through learning how to program front-end pages in Javascript. My end motivation is to gain employment as a web developer possibly leading to full stack programmer.

As part of the bootcamp criteria I was asked to and given a set of instructions on how to build a basic HTML structure with CSS and create some functions using javascript. My brief was to design a platform that included all of the elements that I have been learning from my bootcamp prework.

I created a brief guide with key information about the topics to help me remember the purpose of the programming elements. I particularly liked uploading work onto github using the terminal. I already have some basic knowledge of HTML and CSS but very little experience of javascript. I have learned how to create an array in javascript and apply this to a for loop we then attemped functions and called these through the console.

I now have the start of a webpage which holds some knowledge and instructions to help me to code.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
